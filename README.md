Simple scripts that draw christmas tree.

Bash script Usage:
```
bash christmas.sh <tree size, default 10> <1 for animation>
```

Prints something like this (but colorful!)
```
          *
         ***
        *****
       *******
      *********
     ***********
    *************
   ***************
  *****************
 *******************
         | |
         | |
```

More variants:
* a browser popup version of the script (can use as bookmarklet)
* a full HTML page with a fractal-based tree colored by randomized palette (with particles).
  * See [a demo](https://ydyu.github.io/christmas.html).
